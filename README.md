# Modal-analysis-of-structured-light
MatLab codes to accompany Pinnell, J., Nape, I., Sephton, B., Cox, M., and Forbes, A. "Modal analysis of structured light: a practical tutorial" (2020) 

The code herein allows the user to:
- Compute the detection cell mask required for optical mode projections using a camera (see FindDetCell.m).
- Simulate what the optical field should look like at the detection plane, for diagnostic purposes (see SimOpticalOverlap.m)
- Simulate various optical modal decompositions for different initial structured light beams and different bases (see SimModalDecomp.m)

Codes to generate Hermite-Gaussian (HG.m), Bessel-Gaussian (BG.m) and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG.m) structured light modes are also given for convenience and are required to run the simulation codes.

Please consider acknowledging our work if you have utilised the code herein.
